          <p class="lead">At Toastery Roastery, we are incredibly passionate about offering some of the finest, rarest, and most exciting specialty coffees from around the world. Our subscribers are part of an exclusive club of coffee lovers who receive our 'Toasty Roast', delivered fresh to their doors every month. But have you ever wondered how your delicious cup of coffee begins its life? Letâ€™s take you on an incredible journey that each coffee bean at Toastery Roastery takes, from seed to cup.</p>

          <h2>1. Planting</h2>
          <p>Each coffee journey begins as a tiny seed, carefully planted in large beds in shaded nurseries. After about 60 days, these seeds sprout into seedlings, marking the start of their journey. The seedlings are meticulously cared for, shielded from bright sunlight until they are robust enough to be permanently planted. It's a process that requires a lot of patience, care, and precision.</p>

          <h2>2. Harvesting</h2>
          <p>The coffee trees take 3 to 4 years to bear fruit, known as the coffee cherry. The cherries turn a bright, deep red when they're ripe and ready to be harvested. Coffee cherries don't ripen all at once, which requires multiple harvests. This process is labor-intensive as each cherry must be carefully hand-picked to prevent damage to the fruit and the tree.</p>
